# EdgeOfTheWorldGame

Based on a board game designed by my friend Kelly Houghland.

My development plan:

Stage 1
Display a simplified version of the board.
Game tiles move when EndTurn button is clicked.
  
Stage 2
Add the obstacle tiles.
Have the ship respond appropriately when an obstacle tile is encountered.
Impose loss conditions.

Stage 3
Display full version of the board.
Include both ships.

Stage 4
Allow for movement of tiles within a column.
Keep track of total number of each type of tile.
Allow user to select replacement tiles, subject to availablility of tile type.

Stage 5
Create user database.
Keep track of user stats.
